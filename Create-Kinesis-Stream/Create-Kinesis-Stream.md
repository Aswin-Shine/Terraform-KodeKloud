The Nautilus DevOps team needs to create an AWS Kinesis data stream for real-time data processing. This stream will be used to ingest and process large volumes of streaming data, which will then be consumed by various applications for analytics and real-time decision-making.

The stream should be named nautilus-stream.

Use Terraform to create this Kinesis stream.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Solution : 
```
resource "aws_kinesis_stream" "nautilus-stream" {
  name             = "nautilus-stream"

  stream_mode_details {
    stream_mode = "ON_DEMAND"
  }

}
```
